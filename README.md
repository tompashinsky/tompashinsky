## Hi there! 👋
I'm Tom, a 3rd year student in Digital Sciences for High-Tech & Management at Tel Aviv University. <br>
During my studies I've acquired abilities in programming (Python, C), data analysis, data structures and algorithms. <br>
Moreover, I've learned a lot about retrieving information and research thanks to my long-term hobby in genealogy. <br>
